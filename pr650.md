# Restoring ICM card on the PR650

Our ICM card somehow became "corrupted", and the spectrometer would not 
run on startup - it just displayed a complaint about a corrupt ICM card. 

The spectrometer has a floppy that came with it. This floppy contains two
programs (one for restoring the ICM card, the other for pulling measurement
data off of the unit), along with some data files. One of the data files
is used to restore the ICM card. 

I have no idea why they call it an ICM card. It is a PCMCIA card - specifically
a "256KB SRAM PC Card with 8KB attribute memory [8-bit data transfer]", 
ordered from [this page](https://www.amtron.com/sram.htm#8-bit_or_16-bit_w_attribute).

The exe on the floppy are 16-bit executables, so running them on a modern 
machine was a no-go (I tried it with a DOS emulator called vDOS, but it 
didn't seem to be able to use the serial port). Fortunately, the Ted 
Jones Suite has some older machines, and 
one was willing to boot into Windows7-32 bit. It had a working floppy
and serial ports (we need either COM1 or COM2 according to the docs).

Follow instructions in the manual, chapter 7. 

Running the program:

`> RESTR650 60001208 -c2`

The first several attempts failed. I don't know the exact sequence of 
events that worked, but it SEEMS like I hit ENTER several times (see output
below), and after a few, I hit the light button on the PR650 - just once to 
get the backlight to come on. It may have been slightly different sequence, 
but I noticed that the ACK reply on the PR650 repeatedly said "CMD 41 ACK",
just prior to the failure. After several of these tries (just kept hitting 
RETURN), the communications worked and the restore operation proceeded. 

I did this with both the new ICM card we purchased and the original card as well. 

After this operation, all display options are set to factory defaults. 
I adjusted some, e.g. luminance units to cd/m**2.
